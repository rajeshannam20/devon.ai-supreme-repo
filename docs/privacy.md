# Privacy Policy — DEVONN.AI Assistant

Last updated: October 6, 2025

## Summary

This browser extension (Devonn.AI Assistant) collects only limited data needed to operate: user-provided API keys used to call model/provider APIs, and page text or selected content when you explicitly request processing. We do not sell user data.

## What we collect

- **API keys / authentication information** — API keys or tokens you optionally provide to integrate third‑party LLM or provider services. These are stored locally in Chrome storage.
- **Website content you submit** — page text, selected text, or content you explicitly send to the extension for analysis. The extension only reads page content when you explicitly trigger it.
- **Non-sensitive settings** — a local userId string, preferences, and small caches stored in Chrome storage to improve UX.

## How we use your data

API keys are used only to authenticate requests to the provider you choose. Page content you submit is transmitted to the configured API endpoint over HTTPS for processing (for example: summary, analysis). The extension does not automatically send page contents without explicit user action.

## Sharing and third parties

We do not sell or transfer user data to third parties. We may transmit data to the third‑party API providers you configure (for example: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) because processing is performed on their services. Example provider domains:

- https://api.openai.com
- https://api.anthropic.com
- https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com

Replace the above with the actual providers you support if different.

## Retention

Keys and settings are stored locally (Chrome storage) until you remove them. The extension does not retain submitted page content beyond transient transmission unless you explicitly enable server‑side features in settings.

## Security

All network requests use HTTPS. Stored keys are kept in Chrome storage (local to the browser profile). You can clear keys and settings from the extension settings at any time.

## Your choices

You control whether to provide API keys, whether to send page content, and you can clear stored data in the extension settings or by removing the extension.

By using the extension you agree to this policy.
